Type of Project: Text-Based Adventure Game

This Project was created by Calvin Pettis and Hunter Brickers during the Fall 2024 semester at Appalachian University. The project was submitted as a final project for the Software Engineering course where we presented this Text Based "|left|  |right|" styled Adventure Game. Feel free to do anything to this project other than try to sell it on some kinda market place. xoxo thx. 

The process of you (humble internet user) trying to run this game should go smoother if you clone this repo into your own repository (assuming, you already have maven and java setup somewhere on your local machine)


## STARTING THE GAME:
I downloaded maven and java (any version of maven should workd & any version of java after java17 should work as well).
### To Compile Project
Im pretty sure this sets up the dependancies for javafx so the game can run.
"$>mvn clean package" OR "$>mvn clean build"
### Start BB Game GUI
"$>mvn javafx:run"


# IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS
If you get errors im sorry..
Just send me an email or sum

As of right now there is no way to launch the game with a .exe but I am trying to work on that. XD

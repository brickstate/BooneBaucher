Type of Project: Text-Based Adventure Game
Game Description: You are a student in AppState's CompSci department, you have just left your Software Engineering class and you wonder what will you do tonight. Will you make it to a party where copious amounts of boze await you or do you reject the divine call to party only to go home... ALONE.

Each game scene shows art generated through different AI image generative platfroms, and were doctored up with differnt photo editing tools. All context for the text and game prompts themselves were written by Hunter Brickers and Calvin Pettis and they were not generated with AI. 

This Project was created by Calvin Pettis and Hunter Brickers during the Fall 2024 semester at Appalachian University. The project was submitted as a final project for the Software Engineering course where we presented this Text Based "|left|  |right|" styled Adventure Game. Feel free to do anything to this project other than try to sell it on some kinda market place. xoxo thx. 

The process of you (humble internet user) trying to run this game should go smoother if you clone this repo into your own repository (assuming, you already have maven and java setup somewhere on your local machine)


## STARTING THE GAME:
I downloaded maven and java (any version of maven should workd & any version of java after java17 should work as well).
### To Compile Project
Im pretty sure this sets up the dependancies for javafx so the game can run.

"$>mvn clean package"
### Start BB Game GUI
"$>mvn javafx:run"


# IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS
If you get errors im sorry..
Just send me an email or sum
